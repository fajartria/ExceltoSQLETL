# ExceltoSQLETL
An Example of Python ETL script, from Excel files, to Dataframe, and ultimately into a database (RDBMS)

In this example, I created a Python ETL Script to read Excel files, store them into a Pandas DataFrame, do some Data Transformation process, and then load them into the Database (RDBMS)
The Dataset used here is a fictional Data, a prediction of people who commutes, used cars, used motorbikes, used bikes, or walks to work.
